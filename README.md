## Features

<br/>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 📊 Dataset Health Score
Automatic 0–100 quality score based on missing values, duplicates, constant columns, and outlier density. Colour-coded: Excellent / Good / Needs Cleaning / Poor.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🗂️ Feature Summary
Classifies every column automatically — Numeric, Categorical, Boolean, Datetime, Object — displayed as metric cards at a glance.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔍 Missing Value Analysis
Visual horizontal bar chart showing missing counts per column, sorted by severity. Green success message when your data is clean.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 📈 Distribution Analysis
Histogram + box plot overlay for any numeric column. Pick a column, see its full distribution instantly.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔗 Correlation Heatmap
Interactive Plotly heatmap with selectable method — **Pearson**, **Spearman**, or **Kendall** — updates dynamically.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 📋 Categorical Analysis
Value counts table + bar chart for any categorical column. Adjustable Top N slider to control how many categories to show.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🧹 Data Cleaning Pipeline
Missing value imputation (median, mean, mode, constant, or random sampling), duplicate removal with custom strategies, and outlier handling via IQR or Z-score.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 💾 Export Everything
Download your cleaned dataset as **CSV** or **Excel**, plus a full **JSON cleaning report** that logs every operation applied.
